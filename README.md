Due to a recent update to pb3.0, the current models are outdated and have been incorrectly scaled down. We are currently working on new models, so please be patient.
I have patched out the error which prevented the mod from loading, you can still play with it, if you'd like.

**What is PBVPv2?**
PBVP is an add-on for the DooM mod Project Brutality. Its aim is to turn the 2d pickups and decorations into 3d models that fit the style of DooM without rendering the game unplayable.
