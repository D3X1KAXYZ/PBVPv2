Dear Player or Modder,

	Thank you for downloading Project Brutality Voxel Patch v2 and reading this.
If you use any of the files in this patch for your own mods, please give credit to the ones who made them.
We don't mind if you use this stuff without asking as long as you give us credit.
If possible, you should try to ask, however, we know its not always possible.
While v1 has voxels from other mods, v2 is all "in house." Each voxel model has a marker above it that says who worked on it.

	If you are unfamiliar with PBVP, you probably are confused by all this talk of v1.
Basically, we started over. Version 1 was very experimental and ambitious. It had no standard. The quality of each model varied greatly from voxel to voxel. Some voxels were 8 times the size of the sprite while others were 1 for 1. Organization was a bit rough and trying to convert everything over to polymesh models was quite a daunting task.
I was not happy with the project as a whole. After a consulting with the team, we restarted with a simple goal.

	KEEP IT SIMPLE. 1:1 scale between voxel and sprite. With this new start, a lot of hard work that was put into v1 has been lost. V1 included an acs scripted toggle which gave me a lot of trouble. It did not like me and I had to ask Etto for help. This script allowed the voxels to be switched off or on at the press of a key. This has been scrapped because polymesh is much better for perfomance and v2 does not contain voxels.


	On a similiar note, a shout out to Zedek the Plague Doc., who helped us with the mech animation. Due to the pb 3.0 overhaul, the mech is a depricated feature from bd and will most likely not be part of the final release.

I have to give special thanks to the members of the following discord servers:
	>V5 Add-On (My server)
	>Project Black Mass (the PB Campaign server) <Originally Project Black Metal when I joined>
	>The Official PB server
	>The Official ZDooM server (for help)
Without them, I would not have any reason to continue this project. 
The interest they showed in this project gave me a reason to push on. 
It gave me the resources I needed to bring this idea to life. Its not easy to manage this alone...

Rest In Peace My Sanity XD

	Now, dont get me wrong, there is no way I could have made it this far without my team, but even with them alot of this project fell on my hands since I am the lead developer. 
being a lead developer of a personal (non commercial, non profit, fan made) project like this
 can make it feel like you are working alone a lot of times. 

	I also have to thank OSU! (The game), the makers of the beatmaps, and the musicians behind the music used.
Without the entertainment, I would have definitly lost my mind especially during the mass voxel conversion sessions 
(one of which lasted four hours as I converted 101 voxels from .vox to .kvx.)
	
	On the topic of mass conversions, huge shout out to The_Individualist. 
He did 296 kvx to obj conversions in one weekend.
180 of those he actually redid, because of a bug in MV .99.3, in which the obj export function orients the model with the Y axis up.
This causes the models to come out offcentered and rotated when programmed into gzdoom.
(Fun fact: there were a total of 427 kvx files in the 032218 dev build.)

	Last, but not least, I also have to thank my team, both former and current. 
As I said, I definitly couldn't have gotten this far on my own.

Hope you enjoy the work that was put in to this.

	PS: If a lot of this sounds familiar or doesn't fit v2, thats because the bottom half is from the v1 credits file. Writing a new letter for v2 has not been easy and much of it still applies to v2.
	PSS: A HUGE THANK YOU TO MY PAP-PAP, who loaned me this laptop since my workhorse died. I'd also like to thank Thoth33 for helping me with trying to recover my data.
