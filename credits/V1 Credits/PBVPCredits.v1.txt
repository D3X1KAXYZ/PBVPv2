Dear Player or Modder,

	Thank you for downloading Project Brutality Voxel Patch and reading the credits.
If you use any of the files in this patch for your own voxel patches or mods, please give credit to the ones who made them.
Not everything in these files are original pieces. Some come from BDVP 3-2-1. Some came from the DooM IWads. 
Others came from PB3.0 / BD. I personally have tried to credit everyone who worked on the things inside this project. 
If I have left anyone out, I will gladly add them.

I own none of the sprites.

	The decorate files have specific blocks of code that are mine. Much of the code is from BDVP or PB.
The acs is technically mine, but I have to give some credit to Etto of discord.
Without him, the Decor toggle script would have taken ten times longer for me to get working properly (if I ever got it working.)

	On a similiar note, a shout out to Zedek the Plague Doc., who helped us with the mech animation. 
Under his guidence, we were able to make the mech come to life.

I have to give special thanks to the members of the following discord servers:
	>V5 Add-On (My server)
	>Project Black Mass (the PB Campaign server) <Originally Project Black Metal when I joined>
	>The Official PB server
	>The Official ZDooM server (for help)
Without them, I would not have any reason to continue this project. 
The interest they showed in this project gave me a reason to push on. 
It gave me the resources I needed to bring this idea to life. Its not easy to manage this alone...

Rest In Peace My Sanity XD

	Now, dont get me wrong, there is no way I could have made it this far without my team, but even with them alot of this project fell on my hands since I am the lead developer. 
being a lead developer of a personal (non commercial, non profit, fan made) project like this
 can make it feel like you are working alone a lot of times. 

	I also have to thank OSU! (The game), the makers of the beatmaps, and the musicians behind the music used.
Without the entertainment, I would have definitly lost my mind especially during the mass voxel conversion sessions 
(one of which lasted four hours as I converted 101 voxels from .vox to .kvx.)
	
	On the topic of mass conversions, huge shout out to The_Individualist. 
He did 296 kvx to obj conversions in one weekend.
180 of those he actually redid, because of a bug in MV .99.3, in which the obj export function orients the model with the Y axis up.
This causes the models to come out offcentered and rotated when programmed into gzdoom.
(Fun fact: there were a total of 427 kvx files in the 032218 dev build.)

	Last, but not least, I have to thank my team, both former and current. 
As I said, I definitly couldn't have gotten this far on my own.

Hope you enjoy the work that was put in to this.
															sincerely,
