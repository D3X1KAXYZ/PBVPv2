	StaticText "Q: What is a Voxel(model)?", "gold"
	StaticText "A: A Voxel(model) is a 3d model made of 3d pixels"

	StaticText "[tl;dr] We decided to restart.", "darkred"
	Statictext "A: v1 has a lot of great models in it, but it was too much"
	StaticText "of a mixed bag in terms of quality. There was no standard"
	StaticText "and so quality varied heavily. We were already trying to"
	StaticText "convert over to polymesh. With over 300 voxels,"
	StaticText "trying to standardize v1 was just not going to be feasible."

	StaticText "Q: Polymesh?", "gold"

	StaticText "Q: Isn't this a Voxel pack?", "gold"
	StaticText "A: Yes and no. It depends on what you think makes a voxel pack"
	StaticText "a voxel pack. PBVP v2 does not use Voxeldef and kvx files."
	StaticText ""
	StaticText "Q: WELL THEN WHY IS THIS CALLED A VOXEL PACK?", "gold"
	StaticText "[tl;dr] Visually, You won't be able to tell the difference.", "darkred"
	StaticText "A: All models in the pack adhere to the style of voxel. As a"
	StaticText "of fact, most of them are designed in a voxel editor. More"
	StaticText "complex items may require a helping hand from polymesh models,"
	StaticText "however it still goes through a voxel editor to be finished."
	StaticText ""
	StaticText "Q: So, why polymesh then?", "gold"
	StaticText "A: ZDOOM based source ports are terrible at rendering voxels."
	StaticText "Just 3 voxels can cause the game to become unplayable,"
	StaticText "meanwhile, 20 of that same model in polymesh may cause slight"
